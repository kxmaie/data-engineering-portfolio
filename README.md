# ðŸš€ Data Engineering Portfolio

Hi, I'm Moamen ðŸ‘‹  
This repository is a collection of my **Data Engineering Projects**, covering ETL/ELT pipelines, data warehousing, and workflow orchestration.  
I used tools like **Python, SQL, Apache Airflow, dbt, Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, PostgreSQL** to build end-to-end data solutions.
